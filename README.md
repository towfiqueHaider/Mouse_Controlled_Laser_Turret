<h1>Mouse Controlled Laser Turret</h1>

<h4> 2 degrees of freedom, mouse controlled, laser pointer. </h4>

Arduino code is used to control the Arduino board, and a python script is used to take input from mouse movement. I used chatgpt to make the code a bit clear.

<h1>Components Required:</h1>
Arduino board, 
2x Servos, 
Jumper wires, 
Breadboard (optional)
  
<h1>Wiring Connections:</h1>
<h3>Servo 1 (Horizontal Servo):</h3>

Signal wire (usually yellow or orange): Connect to Arduino pin 9.
Power wire (usually red): Connect to 5V on Arduino or an external power supply.
Ground wire (usually brown or black): Connect to Arduino GND.
<h3>Servo 2 (Vertical Servo):</h3>

Signal wire (yellow or orange): Connect to Arduino pin 10.
Power wire (red): Connect to 5V on Arduino or an external power supply.
Ground wire (brown or black): Connect to Arduino GND.
